# Password Strength Checker

## ✨ Introduction

Password Strength Checker is a simple yet effective Python-based tool that evaluates the strength of user passwords. It ensures that users create strong passwords and provides recommendations for improvement.

## 🔧 Features

- **Password Strength Analysis:** Evaluates the strength based on length, character diversity, and complexity.
- **Scoring System:** Categorizes passwords as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.
- **Improvement Suggestions:** Provides recommendations for making passwords stronger.
- **(Optional) Breach Check:** Uses external APIs to check if the password has been compromised.

## 🌟 How It Works

1. The user inputs a password.
2. The tool analyzes the password based on:
   - Length (minimum recommended: 8 characters)
   - Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Inclusion of numbers and special characters
   - Avoidance of common words and patterns
3. A security score is assigned, and the password is categorized as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**.
4. If weak, the tool provides suggestions to enhance security.
5. (Optional) It checks if the password has been exposed in data breaches using external services.
